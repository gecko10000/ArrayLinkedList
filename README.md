# ArrayLinkedList

This is a failed experiment in which I compared a normal linked list to a linked list in which the node pointers are stored in an array for faster access time. Unfortunately, this idea did not merit much and the array linked list is slower in all operations. Maybe there's something I'm missing and would appreciate some input or a PR.
